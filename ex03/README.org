* The program ex03.01
Write a program to calculate the overtime pay and normal pay. If the hours increase 40 then the pay will be overtime and if not then the pay will be normal.
** Procedure:
First use input to ask the user to input a value for hours and rate
#+begin_src python
hours = input("Enter hours: ")
rate = input("Enter rate per hour: ")
#+end_src

Then convert the input value into float
#+begin_src python
fhours = float(hours)
frate = float(rate)
#+end_src

Then write an if-elif statement which would state that if hours is greater than 40 then give the employee 1.5 times the hourly rate, and if not then give the normal pay
#+begin_src python
if fhours > 40:
    reg = fhours * frate
    otp = (fhours - 40) * (frate * 0.5)
    pay = reg + otp
    print(pay)
elif fhours < 40:
    pay = fhours * frate
    print(pay)

#+end_src
