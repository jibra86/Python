* The program
Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay.

First use input to ask the user to input a value for hours and rate
#+begin_src python
hours = input("Enter hours: ")
rate = input("Enter rate per hour: ")
#+end_src

Then converting the input value into float(decimal point value)
#+begin_src python
fhours = float(hours)
frate = float(rate)
#+end_src

And as we know that hours into rate equal pay and then just print out the pay using the print function.
#+begin_src python
pay = fhours * frate
print("Pay:", pay)
#+end_src
